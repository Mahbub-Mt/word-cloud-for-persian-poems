# word-cloud-for-persian-poems
hereby I have implemented code to creat a wordcloud of the poems of my favorite Iranian poets in persian.
Given to my great enthusiasm for Iranian poets such as Hafez, Saadi, Molana, Ferdowsi and so on, I have created a piece of code in python to visualize their poems at a short glance. It would be helpful for anyone interested in persian literature and poetry.

given to the poems have been extracted from the dataset in Persian_poems_corpus, there was no need to remove stopwords. However, I wrote the code for stop words in case any one may need for other texts.
